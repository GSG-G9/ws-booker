Also, I can see the top-rated workspaces. I can open the profile of any workspace to see all information about it. I can add my rate to the workspace to help other freelancers.And I can book any workspace, specify number of attendants and the date and time.

- As an admin , I can add workspaces information to the website, can edit a workspace information, and delete the workspace.
